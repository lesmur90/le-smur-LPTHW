This is the beginning of my journey into software programming with Zed Shaw.
I have been reading and practicing his materials for a few weeks now.
I love his attention to detail, as well as his requirement to know and understand the fundamentals of the Terminal/Shell.
Learning those commands (with the use of flashcards, as he recommends) has made my journey much easier than if I hadn't.
